## Problem statement
Chicago Transportation (CTA) would like to evaluate how different weather conditions influence different bus routes and L-lines so that CTA can provide better service 
and cost-efficiency, by optimizing frequencies, precise prediction of arrival time, preparing for emergencies, allocating staff, and arranging connecting transportation
around stations based on the weather forecast. Besides, they also need to assess the impact of the pandemic on ridership and traffic distribution for future 
construction plans and strategies. This project will focus on analyzing the CTA ridership between 2018-2022.
